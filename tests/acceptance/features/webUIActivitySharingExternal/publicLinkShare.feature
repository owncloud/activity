Feature: public link sharing file/folders activities
  As a user
  I want to be able to see history of the files and folders shared externally
  So that I know what happened in my cloud storage

  Background:
    Given user "user1" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And user "user1" has logged in using the webUI

  Scenario: Creating a public link of a folder and file should be listed in the activity list
    Given user "user1" has created a public link share of folder "simple-folder"
    And user "user1" has created a public link share of file "textfile0.txt"
    When the user browses to the activity page
    Then the activity number 1 should contain message "You shared textfile0.txt and simple-folder via link" in the activity page

  Scenario: Uploading a file to a public shared folder should be listed in the activity list
    Given user "user1" has created a public link share with settings
      | path        | simple-folder |
      | permissions | create        |
    And the public has uploaded file "test.txt" with content "This is a test"
    When the user browses to the activity page
    Then the activity number 1 should contain message "created test.txt" in the activity page
