Feature: Tag files/folders activities
  As a user
  I want to be able to see history of the files and folders that I have tagged
  So that I know what happened in my cloud storage

  Scenario Outline: Adding a tag on a file/folder should be listed on the activity list
    Given user "user0" has been created with default attributes and skeleton files
    And user "user0" has logged in using the webUI
    And user "user0" has created a "normal" tag with name "lorem"
    # <filepath> already has an ending slash('/')
    And user "user0" has added tag "lorem" to file "<filepath><filename>"
    When the user browses to the activity page
    Then the activity number 1 should contain message "You assigned system tag lorem to <filename>" in the activity page
    Examples:
      | filepath                            | filename            |
      | /                                   | lorem.txt           |
      | simple-folder/                      | testapp.zip         |
      | /                                   | 0                   |
      | 'single'quotes/                     | simple-empty-folder |
      | 0/                                  | lorem.txt           |
      | 'single'quotes/simple-empty-folder/ | for-git-commit      |

  Scenario Outline: Adding a tag on the shared file/folder should be listed on the activity list
    Given these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username |
      | user0    |
      | user1    |
    And group "group1" has been created
    And user "user0" has been added to group "group1"

    And user "user0" has shared file "<filename>" with group "group1"
    And user "user0" has added tag "lorem" to file "<filename>"
    And user "user0" has logged in using the webUI
    When the user browses to the activity page
    Then the activity number 1 should have message "You assigned system tag lorem to <filename>" in the activity page
    And the activity number 2 should have message "You shared <filename> with group group1" in the activity page
    When the user re-logs in as "user1" using the webUI
    And the user browses to the activity page
    Then the activity number 1 should contain message "User Zero assigned system tag lorem to <filename>" in the activity page
    And the activity number 2 should contain message "User Zero shared <filename> with you" in the activity page

      | filename      |
